The project is made up by 3 parts:<br />
1. NLP_stock: This file shows how we train the best model among (Baseline Vader/Naive Bayes/BERT) for sentiment classification.<br />
2. Sentiment_Stock_Dataframe_Generator: This file shows how we do sentiment analysis based on tweet data and stock data.<br />
3. models: This file shows how we train different model based on the sentiment_stockprice data. We used (Random_Forest/LSTM/log_regression/XG_boost/KNN). We designed bot trading techniques which at most outperformed 5% income.
